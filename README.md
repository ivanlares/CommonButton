##Showcase

The images below will show what can be accomplished with this framework.

Run the example project to see the framework in action.

##Installation

For simplicity cocoa-pods is not used. This framework does **not** and will not use 3rd party libraries. You can use [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage) or install it manually without worry about managing a complex framework that imports other frameworks.

## Contributing

Take a look at the [SPECIFICATIONS.md]() file to learn more about what the framework is trying to accomplish. 
Contribute by forking the Github repo and then making a pull request after the framework is updated with your changes.
