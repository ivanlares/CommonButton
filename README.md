CommonButton is a UIButton subclass that adds additional functionality to UIButton. 

For example: 

- round and clipped corners 
- border configuration 
- activity indicator 
- many more commonly desired features

[See specification](https://github.com/ivanlares/CommonButton/blob/master/SPECIFICATIONS.md) for full list of features.


## Usage 


Run the example project to see the framework in action.

**Important:** Use `.custom` UIButton type. The default when initializing button programmatically is `.custom` but in interface builder `.system` is the default.

## Installation

For simplicity cocoa-pods is not used. This framework does **not** and will not use 3rd party libraries. You can use [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage) or install it manually without worrying about managing a complex framework that imports other frameworks.

## Contributing

Take a look at the [SPECIFICATIONS.md](https://github.com/ivanlares/CommonButton/blob/master/SPECIFICATIONS.md) file to learn more about what the framework is trying to accomplish. 
Contribute by forking the Github repo and then making a pull request after the framework is updated with your changes.
